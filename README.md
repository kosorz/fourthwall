## Architecture

According to react [documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#nextjs-app-router)
for production grade application (the way this application should be treated - according to the task description)
one of the frameworks should be used. Selected framework supports caching (one of the requirements - according to
the task description) and parallel routing that is useful for the task.

## Styling

Iâ€™ve decided to use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui primarily to explore and experiment with them. This combination provides
a highly customizable and versatile set of UI components, making it a great choice for building modern and visually
appealing interfaces.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
